we have unobserved Variables being the parameters and observed variables (data). Priors are beliefs about the parameters, 
while The likelihood is the probability of the observed data given the parameters. 
In Bayesian inference, the likelihood connects the observed variables to the unobserved parameters.



I've been pondering deeply about Bayesian probabilistic modeling, and I've stumbled upon an intriguing way to reframe our understanding of the whole process. Here's what I'm thinking:
What if we consider all data not as fixed observations, but as the output of some underlying, unknown probability distribution? This got me thinking about the nature of the likelihood function in a new light.
In traditional Bayesian inference, we have our prior distribution over the parameters, and then we have this likelihood function that tells us how probable our data is given those parameters. But what if we look at it differently?
I'm starting to see the whole process as a comparison between two distinct generative models. On one side, we have our specified prior model with its parameters - that's the model we're working with explicitly. On the other side, we have this hidden, unknown model that's actually generating our observed data.
Now, here's where it gets interesting: what if we reinterpret the likelihood not as a simple probability function, but as a measure of the discrepancy between these two models? It's like we're trying to figure out how different our specified model is from this mysterious data-generating model.
In this view, the whole process of Bayesian inference becomes an attempt to reconcile these two models. We're essentially trying to tweak the parameters of our specified model to make it match the behavior of the unknown data-generating model as closely as possible.
This perspective puts the parameters and the data on more equal footing - they're both just outputs of generative processes. It's a more symmetrical way of looking at things.
I'm excited about this idea because it seems to open up new ways of thinking about probabilistic modeling. It's more abstract, sure, but it might lead us to new insights or methods. Maybe we could develop new approaches to model selection or hierarchical modeling based on this framework.
Of course, I realize this is quite a theoretical perspective, and translating it into practical applications might be challenging. After all, we don't usually have direct access to this data-generating model - that's often why we're doing the inference in the first place. But I can't help but feel that this way of thinking might unlock some new doors in how we approach Bayesian modeling and inference.


How to achiebe potential differentiation wrt Parameters in structurally inspired BayesianModel:


`class BayesianNetwork:
    """Complete probabilistic graphical model"""
    variables: dict[str, RandomVar]
    edges: list[Edge]
    param_size: int
    param_indices: dict[str, Index]  # Track parameter locations

## Data Conceptualization in Probabilistic Inference

In probabilistic inference, we deal with two fundamental types of variables:

1. **Observed Variables (Data)**
   - Fixed arrays that remain constant throughout inference
   - Pure functions: `() -> Array`
   - Represent known measurements or observations

2. **Parameters (Unobserved Variables)**
   - Values to be estimated through inference
   - Functions that select from current state: `Array -> Array`
   - Change during each iteration of the inference process


# Bayesian Model Conceptualization

## Core Idea
All variables (both parameters and data) can be viewed as outputs of generative processes, unified through a common interface:
- Parameters: Generated from prior distributions, updated during inference
- Data: Generated from an unknown true process we're trying to approximate

## Key Insights
1. Both parameters and data are treated as array slices through a common interface
2. The distinction between parameters and data emerges from how they're used:
   - Parameters: Updated during inference (state = current_q)
   - Data: Fixed observations (state = observed_data)
3. Distributions (priors and likelihood) operate uniformly on both types
4. The Index abstraction allows flexible partitioning of both parameter and data spaces

## Practical Benefits
1. Unified interface simplifies implementation
2. Natural support for hierarchical models
3. Easy parameter space exploration through HMC
4. Flexible data partitioning for cross-validation or mini-batching

## Mathematical Connection
This implementation reflects the symmetry in Bayesian inference:
- Prior: p(θ) - Distribution over parameters
- Likelihood: p(y|θ) - Distribution over data given parameters
- Both are treated as probability distributions with the same interface

## Functional motivation for Dual Prior x Likelihood view

``PriorLogProb: Parameters[float] x Data[float] -> LogProb[float]``
e.g. for ``N(0,1)`` consider the following in the context of hmc:
`Parameters <= q_new: Array
data <= [0, 1]: Array`

``LikelihoodLogProb: Parameters[float] x Data[float] -> LogProb[float]``
for Likelihood and ``N(0,1)``:
`Parameters <= q_new: Array
data <= IO -> Array`

``LogProb: Parameters[float] x Data[float] -> LogProb[float]``


# The Dual Nature of Priors and Likelihoods: A Functional Perspective

## Introduction

In probabilistic programming and Bayesian inference, we often treat priors and likelihoods as fundamentally different concepts. However, from a functional programming perspective, they share a remarkable duality that can lead to elegant and unified implementations. In this post, we'll explore this duality and show how concepts from functional programming can help us build better probabilistic programming frameworks.

## The Basic Duality

At their core, both priors and likelihoods map parameters and data to probabilities. In type signature notation:

```haskell
type LogProb = Parameters -> Data -> Float
```

The key difference lies not in their structure but in their interpretation:

- **Prior**: Treats parameters as random variables and data as fixed
- **Likelihood**: Treats data as random variables and parameters as fixed

This subtle difference in interpretation leads to different implementations but identical functional signatures.

## A Functional View

From a functional programming perspective, we can view both priors and likelihoods as instances of the same abstract type. Consider this generic type in Rust:

```rust
struct Probability<P, D, R, Mode> {
    transform: Box<dyn Fn(&P, &D) -> R>,
    _phantom: PhantomData<Mode>
}
```

Or in Haskell:

```haskell
newtype Prob p d a = Prob { runProb :: p -> d -> a }
```

This abstraction captures several important properties:

1. **Functorial Nature**: Both can be mapped over
2. **Monoid Structure**: They compose through addition (in log space)
3. **Profunctor Properties**: They're contravariant in parameters and covariant in result

## Unifying Properties

The unified view reveals several interesting properties:

### 1. Composition

Both priors and likelihoods compose in the same way:

```haskell
compose :: (Num a) => Prob p d a -> Prob p d a -> Prob p d a
compose p1 p2 = Prob $ \params data -> 
    runProb p1 params data + runProb p2 params data
```

### 2. Transformation

They share the same mapping properties:

```haskell
map :: (a -> b) -> Prob p d a -> Prob p d b
map f prob = Prob $ \params data -> 
    f (runProb prob params data)
```

### 3. Sequential Operations

Both can be chained in similar ways through monadic operations:

```haskell
bind :: Prob p d a -> (a -> Prob p d b) -> Prob p d b
```

## Practical Implications

This unified view has several practical benefits:

1. **Generic Algorithms**: Samplers like HMC can work with both priors and likelihoods uniformly
2. **Composition**: Easy combination of multiple priors or likelihoods
3. **Type Safety**: The common interface prevents mixing incompatible probabilities
4. **Code Reuse**: Shared implementations of common operations

## Implementation Examples

Here's a simple implementation in Python using a unified framework:

```python
class Probability(Generic[P, D, R]):
    def __init__(self, transform: Callable[[P, D], R]):
        self.transform = transform
    
    def map(self, f: Callable[[R], Any]) -> 'Probability[P, D, Any]':
        return Probability(lambda p, d: f(self.transform(p, d)))
    
    def compose(self, other: 'Probability[P, D, R]') -> 'Probability[P, D, R]':
        return Probability(lambda p, d: 
            self.transform(p, d) + other.transform(p, d))
```

## Real-World Applications

This unified view becomes particularly powerful when:

1. Implementing new MCMC algorithms
2. Building probabilistic programming languages
3. Creating modular Bayesian models
4. Developing composable inference algorithms

## Conclusion

The duality between priors and likelihoods, when viewed through the lens of functional programming, reveals a beautiful symmetry in probabilistic programming. This unified perspective not only leads to more elegant code but also provides practical benefits in terms of abstraction, reuse, and type safety.

By embracing this functional view, we can build more maintainable and robust probabilistic programming frameworks while gaining deeper insights into the nature of Bayesian inference.
