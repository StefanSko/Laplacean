we have unobserved Variables being the parameters and observed variables (data). Priors are beliefs about the parameters, 
while The likelihood is the probability of the observed data given the parameters. 
In Bayesian inference, the likelihood connects the observed variables to the unobserved parameters.



I've been pondering deeply about Bayesian probabilistic modeling, and I've stumbled upon an intriguing way to reframe our understanding of the whole process. Here's what I'm thinking:
What if we consider all data not as fixed observations, but as the output of some underlying, unknown probability distribution? This got me thinking about the nature of the likelihood function in a new light.
In traditional Bayesian inference, we have our prior distribution over the parameters, and then we have this likelihood function that tells us how probable our data is given those parameters. But what if we look at it differently?
I'm starting to see the whole process as a comparison between two distinct generative models. On one side, we have our specified prior model with its parameters - that's the model we're working with explicitly. On the other side, we have this hidden, unknown model that's actually generating our observed data.
Now, here's where it gets interesting: what if we reinterpret the likelihood not as a simple probability function, but as a measure of the discrepancy between these two models? It's like we're trying to figure out how different our specified model is from this mysterious data-generating model.
In this view, the whole process of Bayesian inference becomes an attempt to reconcile these two models. We're essentially trying to tweak the parameters of our specified model to make it match the behavior of the unknown data-generating model as closely as possible.
This perspective puts the parameters and the data on more equal footing - they're both just outputs of generative processes. It's a more symmetrical way of looking at things.
I'm excited about this idea because it seems to open up new ways of thinking about probabilistic modeling. It's more abstract, sure, but it might lead us to new insights or methods. Maybe we could develop new approaches to model selection or hierarchical modeling based on this framework.
Of course, I realize this is quite a theoretical perspective, and translating it into practical applications might be challenging. After all, we don't usually have direct access to this data-generating model - that's often why we're doing the inference in the first place. But I can't help but feel that this way of thinking might unlock some new doors in how we approach Bayesian modeling and inference.


How to achiebe potential differentiation wrt Parameters in structurally inspired BayesianModel:


`class BayesianNetwork:
    """Complete probabilistic graphical model"""
    variables: dict[str, RandomVar]
    edges: list[Edge]
    param_size: int
    param_indices: dict[str, Index]  # Track parameter locations

    def __init__(self, variables: dict, edges: list[Edge], param_size: int, param_indices: dict[str, Index]):
        self.variables = variables
        self.edges = edges
        self.param_size = param_size
        self.param_indices = param_indices

    def log_prob(self, params: Array) -> LogDensity:
        """
        Compute total log probability of model using views into params array
        
        Args:
            params: Flat array containing all parameters
        """
        def edge_log_prob(edge: Edge) -> LogDensity:
            # Get parameter values directly from params array using indices
            param_values = {
                name: self.param_indices[name].select(params)
                for name in edge.get_parameter_names()
            }
            return edge.log_prob(param_values)

        return jnp.sum(jnp.array([edge_log_prob(edge) for edge in self.edges]))`
